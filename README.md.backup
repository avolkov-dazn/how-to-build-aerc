# How to Build Aerc Mail Client

These instructions are for debian based distributions and will work with Raspberry Pi if a recent version of golang is installed.

## Install dependencies
```shell
sudo apt install w3m dante-client libnotmuch-dev scdoc poppler-utils catimg checkinstall
```

- `w3m` - render html in terminal
- `dante-client` - installs socksify to assist with rendering html locally
- `libnotmuch-dev` - required to compile `notmuch` into the client
- `scdoc` - renders document templates during build time
- `poppler-utils` - provides `pdftotext` to allow converting pdfs to view in client
- `catimg` - allows "viewing" images in terminal window
- `checkinstall` - script to assist with building a package

## Get source code
```shell
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc
cd aerc
```

## Build

```shell
make GOFLAGS=-tags=notmuch PREFIX=/usr/local
```

In some cases with older versions of `scdoc`compilation might end in error when trying to process `aerc-templates.7`. Don't worry all the relevant stuff compiles and the templates can be defined in your own time:

```shell
scdoc < doc/aerc-templates.7.scd > aerc-templates.7
Error at 32:3: Cannot deindent in literal block
make: *** [Makefile:48: aerc-templates.7] Error 1
```

## Create a package

```shell
> sudo checkinstall

checkinstall 1.6.2, Copyright 2009 Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran

 Done. The new package has been installed and saved to

 You can remove it from your system anytime using:

      dpkg -r aerc

# Run `aerc` the first time and complete initial configuration

After the initial configuration you will have a few configuration files in `~/.config/aerc`:

**accounts.conf** - this is where you configure your email accounts:

Config format:
```shell
[personal]
source        = imaps://someusers%40gmail.com:somepassword@imap.gmail.com:993
outgoing      = smtp+plain://someusers%40gmail.com:somepassword@smtp.gmail.com:587
default       = INBOX
smtp-starttls = yes
from          = Full Name <someuser@gmail.com>
copy-to       = Sent
```

For Gmail accounts you will need to generate an application password as described in [Google Documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

**aerc.conf** - has got a few interesting configuration options. This file allows defining filters that will help with rendering `html` or `pdf` in aerc. I have the following filters defined:

```shell
[filters]

# This filter will render html
text/html=/usr/local/share/aerc/filters/html
# This will converst a pdf file to text
application/pdf=pdftotext - - | less
# This will display images in terminal
image/*=catimg -w $(tput cols) -
# Alternatively you could use \display\
image/*=display # Won't work if X isn't installed


# Set your favourite editor to be able to compose messages

[compose]

#
# Specifies the command to run the editor with. It will be shown in an embedded
# terminal, though it may also launch a graphical window if the environment
# supports it. Defaults to $EDITOR, or vi.
editor=vim
```
